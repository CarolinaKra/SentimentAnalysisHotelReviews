# Sentiment Analysis on Tourist Accomodation Reviews
I developed a Sentiment Analysis Model for Tourist Accommodation Reviews using Natural Language Processing Techniques.
The best model achieved a 86.3% accuracy and an f1 with macroaveraging of 64.2% 

## Code and Resources
* **Python version:** 3.7
* **Packages:** gensim, nltk, textblob, re, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas, numpy

## Project Overview
* Developed a model to predict the sentiment of a textual Tourist Accomodation Review
* Showed the keywords that are used in negative and positive reviews.
* Developed different pre-processing techniques using NLP tools. 
* Applied different machine learning models.
* Used pre-trained lexicon based-models for sentiment analysis
* Evaluated the best combination of pre-processing and ML models and the pre-trained model
* The best model achieved an accuracy of 86.3% and an f1 with macroaveraging of 64.2% 
* Found that it is feasable to predict positve and negative reviews, but not so much for nuetral ones.

## Short Backgroung
Tourists always have things to say about their holidays, whether they are good or bad. Tourist online platforms take advantage of this and encourage tourists to leave reviews about the tourism products they consumed while on holiday. These reviews are considered as a rich data source of information both for the tourism industry and for future travellers. 

The number of reviews that exist on a single platform is too high to be analysed manually by a team of people. Hence, Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques together with Machine Learning methods can help in the analysis process. The tourism businesses, such as accommodation providers, should take advantage of these technologies and the existing publicly available reviews datasets to create sentiment analysis models that could help them position themselves ahead in this market.


## Objectives
Create a sentiment analysis model for the tourism industry, especially for the accommodation sector which includes hotels, hostels, B&Bs and holidays resorts among others.
The model will have two main functions:

1.	It will potentially show the keywords that are used in negative and positive reviews and 
2.	It will serve as a predictor for the positivity or negativity of future textual reviews from future customers.
